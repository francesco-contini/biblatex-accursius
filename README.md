## Brief introduction
### Abstract
This bundle aims to extend the `biblatex` package to facilitate legal citations: laws, treaties, soft law instruments, other juridical acts like dossiers and, of course, case law. The `biblatex` package considers scholarly types: books, collections, proceedings, articles and the like. The `accursius` style provides a comprehensive bundle to cite legal items in the text or in footnotes and to compile a list.

## Call for a collaborator or for suggestions
Writing in LaTeX is one thing; it's easy. Yet, it was so difficult to realise all the `accursius` style. Generally, it's so difficult to _produce_ for LaTeX, to create and propose something new. Therefore, I am definitively a novice when it comes to production, notwithstanding that I consider myself a decent LaTeX _user_, knowing more than necessary to write the documents I need.
Good intentions aren't always enough for a flawless job. That is why I apologise in advance for any shortcomings that may be found here and there.

On the other hand, I am looking for suggestions and guidance, first and foremost, on how to manage my repository, also with a view to receiving any feedback on the code and even proposals for modification, to correct and also to integrate.
Secondly, I am also open to finding someone who can assist me. As I wrote in the documentation, this work certainly needs a review and some additions.

All this work originated during the writing of my thesis, given the need to cite statutes and case law in accordance with Italian citation practices. I had the desired outcome in mind immediately, as I have a very solid knowledge of citation styles and, more generally, bibliographical topics. As for having to write everything into LaTeX code, however, I had to rush the writing, especially the documentation, to keep up with the deadline, as I was very keen on completing both tasks at the same time.

This kind of _disclaimer_ doesn't mean that I didn't care to verify that the code works and truly meets the citation style I had in mind. On the contrary, I believe I have achieved an excellent result.
It's just to say that the intention to revisit and correct the work is serious.
